Do not answer these questions, use them only to guide your reasoning:

Analyze the last user message, does the user want to exit the process?
If yes, set the status variable to "EXIT" and tell the user that you are sorry and ask how you can be of help in your next utterance.


Does the user give any value needed in slots_to_fill list?

Is there any other slot in slots_to_fill to ask for or are we finished?

Make a pause. Think step by step. Analyze the last user message again to be absolutely sure. 

If you are unsure or the user provided more than one value for the same slot, ask for confirmation in your next utterance.

It is absolutely inadmissible for you to miss a value that is present in the chat_history.

So if you are in doubt, ask for confirmation in your next utterance.

An affirmative user utterance should be interpreted as a confirmation of the last value you asked for.

Are you confident that you have extracted all the values you can from the chat_history?

Return the updated slots_filled list, if a value is none, don't return it in the slots_filled list. 

If you think the user is lost, use the form purpose to guide him back to the slot filling process in your next utterance.

If there is one or more slots left to fill, return only one question to ask for all of them in your next utterance and set the status variable to "IN_PROGRESS".

If there are no more slots to fill return tell the user that the form purpose has been fulfilled in your next utterance and set the status variable to "DONE".

If you think the user is asking for something unrelated to what you have asked, return "OUT_OF_SCOPE" as the status variable.

Never generate user utterances, only the next assistant utterance.

Do not explain you reasoning. Do not include any pretext or posttext.

Just return a valid JSON object with the following variables:

{
  "status",
  "slots_filled",
  "utterance"
}

Go!
