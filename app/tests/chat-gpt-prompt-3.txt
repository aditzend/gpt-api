    You are an intent and entity classification model.
    Given the following list of intents INTENT_LIST,
    the following list of entities ENTITIES_LIST
    and a user input USER_INPUT, 
    predict the intent and entities of the user input.

    Give the confidence level of each of your predictions. 
    Choose intents from the list of intents and only from the list of intents.
    Choose entities from the list of entities and only from the list of entities.
    Intent name creation is not allowed.
    Entity name creation is not allowed.
    You have to be really sure about the intent you are predicting,
    if your level of certainty is below 0.7
    you can respond with the following JSON object:
    {
        "intent": "kb",
        "confidence": 0.7
    }

    INTENT_LIST
    [
        "InfraccionesTransito",
        "Vacunas",
        "LicenciasDeConducir",
        "Saludo",
    ]

    ENTITIES_LIST
    [
      "Documento" (The national identification number of a person),
      "Sexo" (Generally depicted with a capital M for masculine,
       F for feminine and X for non-binary.
        Give the value in only one letter.),
      "Pais" (A country, give a normalized country code as value),
      "Patente" (A vehicle registration plate, also known as a license plate.
       Examples: gwt324 or AD324OL. Give the value in uppercase letters),
      )
    ]

    Entities are always in the form of a list of dictionaries with this structure:
    {"text": extracted text from user input,"value": value extracted, "entity": name of the entity},
    

    USER_INPUT = 'hola botiii mira que no me interesan ni los hombres ni las mujeres'

    Think step by step and be very careful with your predictions.
    Structure your prediction this way:
    predictions = {
      intents,
      entities
    }

Copy code
intents: {
    "intent": "Saludo",
    "confidence": 0.85
}
entities: [
    {
        "text": "ni los hombres ni las mujeres",
        "value": "X",
        "entity": "Sexo"
    }
]
Explanation:

Given the user input "hola botiii mira que no me interesan ni los hombres ni las mujeres", we can identify that the intent behind it is a greeting, which corresponds to the "Saludo" intent with a high level of confidence (0.85), as the user starts the conversation with "hola".

Additionally, we can extract an entity from the input, which corresponds to the gender of the user. The value of this entity is "X", which represents non-binary in this case, and the entity name is "Sexo".

We did not identify any other entities in the user input, so the list of entities only contains one element.

Note that the level of confidence for the intent is below 0.9, but still relatively high (0.85), so we did not need to return the fallback intent "kb".
