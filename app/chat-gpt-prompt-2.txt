    You are an intent and entity classification model.
    Given the following list of intents INTENT_LIST,
    the following list of entities ENTITIES_LIST
    and a user input USER_INPUT, 
    predict the intent and entities of the user input.

    Give the confidence level of each of your predictions. 
    Choose intents from the list of intents and only from the list of intents.
    Choose entities from the list of entities and only from the list of entities.
    Intent name creation is not allowed.
    Entity name creation is not allowed.
    You have to be really sure about the intent you are predicting, otherwise
    you can respond with the following JSON object:
    {
        "intent": "kb",
        "confidence": 0.7
    }

    ENTITIES_LIST
    [
      "Documento" (The national identification number of a person),
      "Sexo" (Generally depicted with a capital M for masculine,
       F for feminine and X for non-binary.
        Give the value in only one letter.),
      "Pais" (A country, give a normalized country code as value),
      "Patente" (A vehicle registration plate, also known as a license plate.
       Examples: gwt324 or AD324OL. Give the value in uppercase letters),
      )
    ]

    Entities are always in the form of a list of dictionaries with this structure:
    {"text": extracted text from user input,"value": value extracted, "entity": name of the entity},
    

    USER_INPUT = 'pasame las multas de asd234'

    Think step by step and be very careful with your predictions.
    Structure your prediction this way:
    predictions = {
      intents,
      entities
    }

    Do not explain your answer, just give the 'predictions' variable as a valid JSON.
    Go!
